# aem-cloud-service-source-migration

This monorepo contains the code refactoring tools that help customers to migrate to AEM as a
 Cloud Service.

# Available Tools
-   [Dispatcher Converter](./packages/dispatcher-converter) - configuring existing on-premise or
 Adobe Managed Services (AMS) dispatcher configurations to AEM as a Cloud Service compatible
 dispatcher configuration.
-   [Repository Modernizer](./packages/repository-modernizer) - restructure existing projects
  into AEM as a Cloud Service compatible packages.
-   [Index Converter](./packages/index-converter) - migrate existing Custom Oak Index Defintions

## Setup
```
    npm install yarn lerna -g
    yarn install
```
        
## Test
```
    yarn test
```

## Publishing to npm
This repository has been configured to automatically publish the tool packages to `npm` registry.
 Publishing packages involve two components :
#### 1. Changesets
We leverage [changesets](https://github.com/atlassian/changesets) which lets contributors declare
 how their changes should be released, automates updating package versions, and changelogs, and
  publishing new versions of packages based on the provided information.
A `changeset` is an intent to release a set of packages at particular semver bump types with a
 summary of the changes made.
The `@changesets/cli` package allows us to create multiple `changeset` files as we make changes,
 then combine any number of `changeset` files into a release. A `changeset` is created using the
  `changeset CLI` using the command below :
```
yarn changeset
```
When run, we get a number of questions about which packages are affected and what semver range
 this `changeset` should bump (major, minor, or patch).
```shell script
maji@MAJI-WX-2 MINGW32 ~/Documents/GitHub/aem-cloud-service-source-migration (master)
$ yarn changeset
yarn run v1.22.4
$ C:\Users\maji\Documents\GitHub\aem-cloud-service-source-migration\node_modules\.bin\changeset

�  Changeset added! - you can now commit it

�  info C:\Users\maji\Documents\GitHub\aem-cloud-service-source-migration\.changeset\fluffy-turkeys-wink.md
Done in 101.92s.
```
This will produce a `changeset` file (./changest/fluffy-turkeys-wink.md) whose content would look something like :
```markdown
---
"@adobe/aem-cs-source-migration-dispatcher-converter": patch
---
Fixing rule file and rewrite path in farm and vhost files
```
This `changeset` file will get deleted automatically later (and merged into the CHANGELOG.md) when our
 Github Action processes it. Please create a `changeset` for each package that needs to be published.

#### 2. Github Action
The preconfigured [Github publish action](https://github.com/adobe/aem-cloud-service-source-migration/blob/master/.github/workflows/publish.yml)
 will look for the presence of `changeset` files in all commits to `master` branch. If found, it
 will automatically create a PR including all of the version bumps and `CHANGELOG.mds` that need
 to happen from any given `changeset`. We can then merge that PR after reviewing all the version bumps.
 Merging will trigger the automated publish for the mentioned packages to the `npm` registry.
