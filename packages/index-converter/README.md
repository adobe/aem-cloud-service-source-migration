# @adobe/aem-cs-source-migration-index-converter

`aem-cs-source-migration-index-converter` provides the capability to transform on-premise *Custom OAK Index Definitions* to *AEM as a Cloud Service compatible OAK Index Definitions*.


# Introduction

Index Converter allows Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) developers to migrate existing *Custom Oak Index Definitions* to *AEM as a Cloud Service compatible Custom Oak Index Definitions*. This utility transforms only lucene type Custom Oak Index Definitions which are present under `/apps` or `/oak:index`.
It will not transform those lucene type indexes which are created for 'nt:base'.

There are two ways to create Custom Oak Index Definitions:
* either under `/apps` (through any custom content package) 
* directly under `/oak:index path`.

Refer to [Ensure Oak Index](https://adobe-consulting-services.github.io/acs-aem-commons/features/ensure-oak-index/index.html) to learn how to define and create Oak Definitions. These were created (in place of actual Oak index definitions) so that they do not wipe out the actual index data when updating the node, necessitating a reindex. 

AEM as a Cloud Service has no support for Ensure Definitions, and hence they need to be converted to Oak Index Definitions (then further migrated into AEM as a Cloud Service compatible Custom Oak Index Definitions) as per below guidelines:

* If property ignore is set to true, ignore/skip the Ensure Definition
* Update the `jcr:primaryType` to `oak:QueryIndexDefinition`
* Remove any properties that are to be ignored as mentioned in OSGi configurations
* Remove subtree `/facets/jcr:content` from Ensure Definition

Custom Oak Index Definitions are categorized as:

* **Custom OOTB (Product) Oak Index Definitions**: Modification into existing OOTB Oak Index Definitions
-* **Newly created Oak Index Definitions**

## Operations For Custom OOTB (Product) Oak Index Definition

* This tool will parse the Custom OOTB (Product) Oak Index Definition and fetch the associated OOTB Index Definition.
* It will compare the Custom OOTB Oak Index Definition to the associated OOTB Index Definition and retrieve the difference between Custom OOTB Index Definition. and associated OOTB Index Definition. That difference or delta is basically customization done by the user in OOTB Oak Index Definition. 
* It will validate the retrieved customization as per AEM as Cloud Service compatible OAK Index Definitions guidelines.
* It will merge validated customization of Custom OOTB Oak Index Definition to corresponding OAK Index Definition present on AEM as a Cloud Service.

## Naming Conventions for Custom OOTB (Product) Oak Index Definition

   ```"Name of the corresponding OAK Index Definition on AEM as a Cloud Service"-"latest version of this index on AEM as a Cloud Service "-"custom"-1```

      eg. damAssetLucene-6-custom-1

## Operations For Newly created Custom Oak Index Definition

* It will parse and validate the Custom Oak Index Definition as per AEM as Cloud Service compatible OAK Index Definitions guidelines.
* It will rename the Custom Oak Index Definition.

## Naming Conventions for Newly created Custom Oak Index Definition :

   ```"Name of the Custom Oak Index Definition"-"custom"-1```

      for example, testindex-custom-1

This tool will update the filter path in filter.xml as well based on the new name of Custom OAK Index Definitions.

   for example, from ```<filter root="/oak:index/damAssetLucene1"/> to <filter root="/oak:index/damAssetLucene-6-custom-1"/>```


# Usage

While it is recommended to use this tool via our [AIO CLI plugin for source migration](https://github.com/adobe/aio-cli-plugin-aem-cloud-service-migration), it can also be executed standalone.
 

## Installation

This project uses [node](http://nodejs.org) and [npm](https://npmjs.com). Check the resources for installation.

It can be installed like any other Node.js module.

```shell script
$ npm install @adobe/aem-cs-source-migration-index-converter
```

## Adding the Module Requirement

To add the module to your `Node.js` project:

1. [Install](#install) the module in your project.
2. Add the `require` function in the module in the javascript file where it will be consumed:

```javascript
const IndexConverter = require('@adobe/aem-cs-source-migration-index-converter');
```

## Executing the Index Conveter Tool

To execute the index-converter tool locally :
1. Run `git clone git@github.com:adobe/aem-cloud-service-source-migration.git` to clone the
 repository locally
2. Navigate to the `index-converter` folder
3. Run `npm install` to install all the required dependencies
4. Inside the `executors` folder:
    * add the required configurations to `config.yaml`. Refer to [Configurations](#configurations)
     sections bellow to know more.
    * run `node index-converter.js` to execute the tool
    * `./target/index/` will contain the resulting restructured projects

## Specifying the Configurations

The following configurations are required for the Index Converter utility:

* `ensureIndexDefinitionContentPackageJcrRootPath` : Absolute path to the jcr_root directory of the package
 containing the **Ensure Index Definitions** (please ignore if there are no Ensure Index Definitions).
* `ensureIndexDefinitionConfigPackageJcrRootPath` : Absolute path to the jcr_root directory of the package
 containing the **Ensure Index OSGI Configuration** (please ignore if there are no Ensure Index Definitions).
* `aemVersion` : Version of AEM customer is on, used to determine the baseline index definitions.
* `customOakIndexDirectoryPath` : Path to the customer OAK Index Definition directory.
* `filterXMLPath` : Path to the existing package `filter.xml` file.

## Example Code

```@yaml
indexConverter:
    # Absolute path to the jcr_root directory of the package containing the Ensure Index Definitions
    # (please ignore if there are no Ensure Index Definitions)
    # eg. /Users/xyz/sampleCode/content/src/main/content/jcr_root
    ensureIndexDefinitionContentPackageJcrRootPath: "/Users/xyz/sampleCode/content/src/main/content/jcr_root"
    # Absolute path to the jcr_root directory of the package containing the Ensure Oak Index OSGI Configuration
    # (please ignore if there are no Ensure Index Definitions)
    # eg. /Users/xyz/sampleCode/CONFIG/src/main/content/jcr_root
    ensureIndexDefinitionConfigPackageJcrRootPath: "/Users/xyz/sampleCode/CONFIG/src/main/content/jcr_root"
    # Version of AEM customer is on, used to determine the baseline index definitions
    aemVersion: 64
    # Path to the customer OAK Index Definition directory
    # (please ignore if there are no Custom Oak Index Definitions under /oak:index)
    # eg /Users/xyz/sampleCode/ui.apps/src/main/content/jcr_root/_oak_index
    customOakIndexDirectoryPath:"/Users/xyz/sampleCode/ui.apps/src/main/content/jcr_root/_oak_index"
    # Path to the existing package `filter.xml` file
    # eg /Users/xyz/sampleCode/ui.apps/src/main/content/META-INF/vault/filter.xml
    filterXMLPath:"/Users/xyz/sampleCode/ui.apps/src/main/content/META-INF/vault/filter.xml"
```
